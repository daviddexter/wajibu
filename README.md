# WAJIBU

## Governance sentiment analysis and aggregator

### What is Wajibu?
Wajibu is an online web app that collects,analyses, aggregates and visualizes sentiments
from the public pertaining the government of a nation. This tool allows citizens to contribute
to the governance talk by airing out their honest views about the state of the nation and in
particular the people placed in government or leadership positions.

Three keys concepts resonants with good leadership

**Integrity.**

**Honor.**

**Service for all.**


In Kenya there is a deficiency of elected leaders who embody true leadership traits.This is not
entirely true because out of the 40 million plus,of the populus,there are indivuduals who have
true leadership traits yet such individuals are never elected into office.

While we cannot stop the electorate from putting into office a person of their choice,we can 
educate them not to **REELECT** unworthy individuals into office. Wajibu is therefore an effort 
to track officebearers,curating their achievements,underachievements,deeds and misdeeds so that by the end of elected term, the electorate can review, from their own views gathered from the entire span,whether
the person is fit to be relected back into office.

Some of the the questions that Wajibu seeks to answer are;

> **If a leader is a good leader,how good is he/she?**

> **If a leader is a bad leader,how bad is he/she?**

> **If a leader is performing,how good is he/she performing?**

> **If a leader is accontable,how accountable is he/she?**


### Leadership analysis pillars


**Integrity**

> Quality of honesty and having strog moral uprightness.

**Transparency**

> Performing task in an open and clear manner.

**Accountability**

> Taking responsiblity of ones actions.

**Cohesive**

> Element of forming a united whole.

**Performance and Service Delivery**

Wajibu uses the five pillars to collect views from grassroot electorate for each elected leader,
performs data analyis to track negative,positive and neutral views then maps on scale charts.

**Positive Views** indicate public approval.

**Negative Views** indicate public disapproval.

**Neutral Views** indicate public reservation.

**Views** are equivalent to Twitter tweets but rather than being general,the subject of each view
is attached to a specific pillar.
